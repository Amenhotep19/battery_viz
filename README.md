#Battery + WiFi viz
===================

A web application to get and report info about the status of the battery and 
of the available wifi networks.

To run the example, you need nodejs and Python 2.7 installed on your system.

* Please open a terminal window, browse to the root folder for the project, and run _'node server'_: this will start a local server (on port 8080) that serves static content for the client part of the application;

* The application will be accessible at the address localhost:8080//

##Details of the implementation

For the client part, I used several libraries:

* jQuery 2,

* Bootstrap,

* RequireJs, to create a clean design with AMD modules,

* Ractive
